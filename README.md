For information and instructions on how to use the simulation model, click on the Info tab on the top left of the viewing window.

The extent to which the whole interface of the simulation model is visible may depend on the screen size of the device used. 
In order to zoom in or out of the model to see the full interface, press
- 'Ctrl' and '-' to zoom out, 
- 'Ctrl' and '+' to zoom in, and 
- 'Ctrl' and '0' to reset to the original viewing size. 

Please note changes in text labels (Widget Font-size) in the interface may occur due to a known "bug" in the NetLogo software described in https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/pull/805 and https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/issues/802
Minor fix in the bug allows widget font to return to normal size when zoom level is reset using 'Ctrl' and '0'.

Some devices may note a reduction/change in the size of the viewing window, such that it does not align with monitors as originaly set, this too is the result of a known "bug" in the NetLogo software described in https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/issues/409
